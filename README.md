## Project Description
Frozen aired at 2013 and it became a mass phenomena, positioning itself number 4 in the ranking of movies which collected more revenue. On the 21st of November, it aired Frozen 2, so will we see again this phenomena?


## Questions & Hypotheses
My question is whether Frozen 2 will be a success or a failure in comparison to Frozen(2013).
In order to assess if Frozen 2 will be more or less successful than Frozen, it is important to define what success is in a movie. In my case, I think that the variables that will contribute to a movie being successful are ratings and budget. Hence, my study will be based on studying the relationship between 

## Dataset
I used a csv file with the [IMDB dataset of movies](https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies). In the dataset we can find the following information:
 - budget: Money invested for promotion of movie.
 - company: Producer of the movie.
 - country: Country of company.
 - director: Director of movie
 - genre: Genre of movie.
 - gross: Money collected from movie.
 - name: Name of movie.
 - rating: Rating for audience (for instance, R-rated)
 - released: Date of release.
 - runtime: Length of movie.
 - score: Grade of movie.
 - star: Main actor/actress appearing in the movie.
 - votes: Number of people who voted the movie in IMDB.
 - writer: Original writer of the script of the movie
 - year: Year of release.

## Workflow
First of all I created my question then I explored the dataset,I analyzed it and finally I got some conclusions.

## Organization
I used trello in order to organize my project.
My repository has 3 folders:
 - Code
 - Database
In the 1st folder (Code) you will find the Jupyter notebooks for 1.Data_Cleaning, 2. Descriptive analysis, and 3. Relationship Analysis between the variables.
In Database you will find a folder called Clean, where data after 1.Data_Cleaning in format .csv. There is also the main file containing the IMDB database called movies.csv.
